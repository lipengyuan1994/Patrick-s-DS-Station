# Lesson 3 Exercise 2 Solution: Focus on Primary Key
<img src="images/cassandralogo.png" width="250" height="250">

### Walk through the basics of creating a table with a good Primary Key in Apache Cassandra, inserting rows of data, and doing a simple CQL query to validate the information.

#### We will use a python wrapper/ python driver called cassandra to run the Apache Cassandra queries. This library should be preinstalled but in the future to install this library you can run this command in a notebook to install locally: 
! pip install cassandra-driver
#### More documentation can be found here:  https://datastax.github.io/python-driver/

#### Import Apache Cassandra python package


```python
import cassandra
```

### Create a connection to the database


```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
try: 
    cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1']) #If you have a locally installed Apache Cassandra instance
    session = cluster.connect()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Create a keyspace to work in 


```python
try:
    session.execute("""
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS udacity 
    WITH REPLICATION = 
    { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 }"""
)

except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Connect to the Keyspace. Compare this to how we had to create a new session in PostgreSQL.  


```python
try:
    session.set_keyspace('udacity')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Imagine you need to create a new Music Library of albums 

### Here is the information asked of the data:
### 1. Give every album in the music library that was created by a given artist
select * from music_library WHERE artist_name="The Beatles"


### Here is the Collection of Data

### How should we model these data? 

#### What should be our Primary Key and Partition Key? Since the data are looking for the ARTIST, let's start with that. Is Partitioning our data by artist a good idea? In this case our data is very small. If we had a larger dataset of albums, partitions by artist might be a fine choice. But we would need to validate the dataset to make sure there is an equal spread of the data. 

`Table Name: music_library
column 1: Year
column 2: Artist Name
column 3: Album Name
Column 4: City
PRIMARY KEY(artist_name)`


```python
query = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS music_library"
query = query + "(year int, artist_name text, album_name text, city text, PRIMARY KEY (artist_name))"
try:
    session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Insert the data into the tables


```python
query = "INSERT INTO music_library (year, artist_name, album_name, city)"
query = query + " VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)"

try:
    session.execute(query, (1970, "The Beatles", "Let it Be", "Liverpool"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, (1965, "The Beatles", "Rubber Soul", "Oxford"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, (1965, "The Who", "My Generation", "London"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, (1966, "The Monkees", "The Monkees", "Los Angeles"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, (1970, "The Carpenters", "Close To You", "San Diego"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Let's Validate our Data Model -- Did it work?? If we look for Albums from The Beatles we should expect to see 2 rows.

`select * from music_library WHERE artist_name="The Beatles"`


```python
query = "select * from music_library WHERE artist_name='The Beatles'"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
for row in rows:
    print (row.year, row.artist_name, row.album_name, row.city)
```

    1965 The Beatles Rubber Soul Oxford


### That didn't work out as planned! Why is that? Because we did not create a unique primary key. 

### Let's try again. This time focus on making the PRIMARY KEY unique.
### Looking at the dataset, what makes each row unique?

### We have a couple of options (City and Album Name) but that will not get us the query we need which is looking for album's in a particular artist. Let's make a composite key of the `ARTIST NAME` and `ALBUM NAME`. This is assuming that an album name is unique to the artist it was created by (not a bad bet). --But remember this is just an exercise, you will need to understand your dataset fully (no betting!)


```python
query = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS music_library1 "
query = query + "(artist_name text, album_name text, year int, city text, PRIMARY KEY (artist_name, album_name))"
try:
    session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```


```python
query = "INSERT INTO music_library1 (artist_name, album_name, year, city)"
query = query + " VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)"

try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Beatles", "Let it Be", 1970, "Liverpool"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Beatles", "Rubber Soul", 1965, "Oxford"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Who", "My Generation", 1965, "London"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Monkees", "The Monkees", 1966, "Los Angeles"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Carpenters", "Close To You", 1970, "San Diego"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Validate the Data Model -- Did it work? If we look for Albums from The Beatles we should expect to see 2 rows.

`select * from music_library WHERE artist_name="The Beatles"`


```python
query = "select * from music_library1 WHERE artist_name='The Beatles'"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
for row in rows:
    print (row.year, row.artist_name, row.album_name, row.city)
```

    1970 The Beatles Let it Be Liverpool
    1965 The Beatles Rubber Soul Oxford


### Success it worked! We created a unique Primary key that evenly distributed our data. 

### Drop the tables


```python
query = "drop table music_library"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

query = "drop table music_library1"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Close the session and cluster connection


```python
session.shutdown()
cluster.shutdown()
```


```python

```
