    "The simplest type of data we have see might consist a single table with a some columns and some rows. This sort of data is easy to analyze and compute and we generally want to reduce our data to a single table before we start running machine learning algorithms. Yet, real world data doesn't necessarily fit into this paradigm.  Most real world data is messy and complicated which doesn't fit well into a tabular format and we will have to do some work to reduce this complexity.  Additionally, in many case we can reduce our memory cost by not keeping data in a single table, but instead in a set of data structures with defined relations between them. \n",
