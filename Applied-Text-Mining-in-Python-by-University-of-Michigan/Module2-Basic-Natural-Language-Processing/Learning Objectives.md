# Learning Objectives
Compare text classification to other classification approaches (covered in Applied Machine Learning in Python as well)
Describe the Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms
Classify text in two classes using one of these approaches in Python
Identify and extract features from text and transform them into feature vectors for the machine learning models
