# Lesson 3 Exercise 3 Solution: Focus on Clustering Columns

### Walk through the basics of creating a table with a good Primary Key and Clustering Columns in Apache Cassandra, inserting rows of data, and doing a simple CQL query to validate the information.

#### We will use a python wrapper/ python driver called cassandra to run the Apache Cassandra queries. This library should be preinstalled but in the future to install this library you can run this command in a notebook to install locally: 
! pip install cassandra-driver
#### More documentation can be found here:  https://datastax.github.io/python-driver/

#### Import Apache Cassandra python package


```python
import cassandra
```

### Create a connection to the database


```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
try: 
    cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1']) #If you have a locally installed Apache Cassandra instance
    session = cluster.connect()
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Create a keyspace to work in 


```python
try:
    session.execute("""
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS udacity 
    WITH REPLICATION = 
    { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 }"""
)

except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Connect to our Keyspace. Compare this to how we had to create a new session in PostgreSQL.  


```python
try:
    session.set_keyspace('udacity')
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Imagine we would like to start creating a new Music Library of albums. 

### We want to ask 1 question of our data:
#### 1. Give me all the information from the music library about a given album
`select * from album_library WHERE album_name="Close To You"`


### Here is the Data:

### How should we model this data? What should be our Primary Key and Partition Key? 

### Since the data is looking for the `ALBUM_NAME` let's start with that. From there we will need to add other elements to make sure the Key is unique. We also need to add the  `ARTIST_NAME` as Clustering Columns to make the data unique. That should be enough to make the row key unique.

`Table Name: music_library
column 1: Year
column 2: Artist Name
column 3: Album Name
Column 4: City
PRIMARY KEY(album name, artist name)`


```python
query = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS music_library "
query = query + "(album_name text, artist_name text, year int, city text, PRIMARY KEY (album_name, artist_name))"
try:
    session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Insert the data into the table


```python
query = "INSERT INTO music_library (album_name, artist_name, year, city)"
query = query + " VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)"

try:
    session.execute(query, ("Let it Be", "The Beatles", 1970, "Liverpool"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, ("Rubber Soul", "The Beatles", 1965, "Oxford"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
try:
    session.execute(query, ("Beatles For Sale", "The Beatles", 1964, "London"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, ("The Monkees", "The Monkees", 1966, "Los Angeles"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    session.execute(query, ("Close To You", "The Carpenters", 1970, "San Diego"))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Validate the Data Model -- Did it work?
`select * from album_library WHERE album_name="Close To You"`


```python
query = "select * from music_library WHERE album_NAME='Close To You'"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    
for row in rows:
    print (row.artist_name, row.album_name, row.city, row.year)
```

    The Carpenters Close To You San Diego 1970


### Success it worked! We created a unique Primary key that evenly distributed our data, with clustering columns

### For the sake of the demo, drop the table


```python
query = "drop table music_library"
try:
    rows = session.execute(query)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

```

### Close the session and cluster connection


```python
session.shutdown()
cluster.shutdown()
```


```python

```
