Just as we had a `Salary` class, a `Degree` class, an `Employee` class, etc. we could imagine a company having a `Salaries` table, `Degrees` table, and `Employees` table. Each row of one of these tables would be similar to a single object of that type (i.e. an instance of a class).\n",

These tools can connect to databases and allow us to treat relations in the database as Python objects. This can be very useful for annotating SQL relations with global constants (such as an important date) and routine functions for analysis. It also allows for seamless integration of database relations into applications as fully-fledged Python objects.\n",

Our classes will inherit from a special base class that hooks into `SQLAlchemy`. **Be warned**, there's a lot going on in these class definitions and they will look different from other class definitions in order to support SQL operations. Looking below we'll notice several patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All classes inherit from Base, possibly through other classes\n",
    "1. All classes are associated with a SQL table via a `__tablename__` variable\n",
    "1. There is no `__init__` method for initializing attributes; instead attributes are declared as variables of the type `sql.Column`\n",
    "1. The attributes are typed; below we use the types `sql.Integer` and `sql.String`\n",
    "1. All classes contain at least one `primary_key`\n",
    "1. Relationships between classes/tables are accomplished through use of `sql.orm.relationship` and `sql.ForeignKey`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some relationships managed by inheritance. Just as before, since `Manager` inherits from `Employee`, we don't need to add columns for production, name, salary, etc. At a SQL level, there is a `managers` table with `idn` and `capacity` columns that gets joined to the `employees` table (by `idn`) any time we want to know a manager's name (or production, or salary, etc.). This helps the SQL backend follow good database design principles."

    "The `@hybrid_method` and `@hybrid_attribute` decorators are where `SQLAlchemy` starts to help us. Often we will be interested in some combination of attributes in a table. For instance, we might want to know an employee's annual salary. We can calculate this as their salary per pay period times the number of pay periods in the year. Rather than store the annual salary in the table (which would be redundant), we can tell `SQLAlchemy` to calculate this on the fly and treat it as an attribute. This way, I can interact with attributes of my objects in the same way whether they are actually stored in the underlying database or not. This can be particularly useful when the attribute has a complex definition.\n",
